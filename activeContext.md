# üìù Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus has been on refactoring the `Home.jsx` page into smaller, more manageable and reusable components to improve code organization, readability, and maintainability.

## Recent Changes
- **`Home.jsx` Refactoring:**
    - Extracted the "Projects Section" into `src/pages/Home/components/ProjectsSection.jsx`.
    - Extracted the "Stats Section" into `src/pages/Home/components/StatsSection.jsx`.
    - Extracted the "Contact Section" into `src/pages/Home/components/ContactSection.jsx`.
    - Extracted the "Easter Egg" section into `src/pages/Home/components/EasterEgg.jsx`.
    - Extracted the "Footer" section into `src/pages/Home/components/Footer.jsx`.
    - Updated `Home.jsx` to import and use these new components.
    - Ensured data (like `projects` and `stats`) is passed as props to the respective components.
    - Corrected icon imports and usage within `StatsSection.jsx` and `Home.jsx`.
    - Removed unused imports from `Home.jsx`.

## Next Steps
- Verify the application runs without errors after the refactoring.
- Ensure all sections render correctly and maintain their original functionality and styling.
- Potentially further refactor `HeroSection`, `AboutSection`, and `SkillsSection` if they grow in complexity or require more granular control.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Component Granularity:** Decided to break down `Home.jsx` into distinct functional sections to enhance modularity.
- **Data Flow:** Maintained data definitions (e.g., `skills`, `projects`, `stats`) in `Home.jsx` and passed them down as props, centralizing data management.
- **Icon Handling:** Standardized icon usage by passing string names for Iconify icons and directly importing Lucide icons within their respective components.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The refactoring process highlighted the importance of precise `replace_in_file` operations, leading to a fallback strategy of using `write_to_file` for larger or more complex changes to ensure accuracy.
- Confirmed the benefits of component-based architecture in improving code readability and making it easier to locate and modify specific UI elements.
