## What Works
- The portfolio website is now structured with a clear component hierarchy.
- All major sections (`Hero`, `About`, `Skills`, `Projects`, `Stats`, `Contact`, `Easter Egg`, `Footer`) are implemented as separate, reusable components.
- Data for `skills`, `projects`, and `stats` is centrally managed in `Home.jsx` and passed down as props.
- Basic styling with Tailwind CSS is applied.
- Framer Motion animations are integrated for a dynamic user experience.
- The easter egg functionality is implemented.

## What's Left to Build
- Ensure all components are fully functional and visually consistent across different screen sizes.
- Implement any missing interactive features or animations within the newly created components.
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any remaining bugs or display issues.
- Optimize performance further if necessary.

## Current Status
The project is in a refactoring and integration phase. The core structure is in place, and the focus is now on verifying the integrity and functionality of the separated components.

## Known Issues
- Previously, there was a `ReferenceError` for `stats` not being defined in `Home.jsx` after refactoring, which has been resolved by re-adding the `stats` array to `Home.jsx`.
- Initial attempts to use `replace_in_file` for large-scale changes in `Home.jsx` were problematic due to strict matching requirements, necessitating a switch to `write_to_file` for comprehensive updates.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to break down `Home.jsx` into numerous smaller components was driven by the need to improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability, aligning with best practices for large React applications. This also makes it easier to debug and add new features in the future.
- The approach to icon management (using string names for Iconify and direct imports for Lucide) was standardized to ensure consistency and proper rendering within the new component structure.
